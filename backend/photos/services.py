    OPTIMIZED: Service function to perform face recognition on uploaded photos.
    Now uses pre-computed face encodings from the database for massive speedup.
    
    PERFORMANCE:
    - OLD: Load and encode N profile pics every time = O(N Ã— M) where M = photos
    - NEW: Load pre-computed encodings from DB = O(N) once, then O(1) per photo
    - Expected speedup: 10-100x depending on number of users
    
    WORKFLOW:
    1. Copy original to public_image
    2. Load pre-computed face encodings from database (FAST!)
    3. Detect faces in uploaded photo
    4. Match faces to known encodings
    5. Create consent requests (excluding uploader)
    6. Mask all faces
    7. Unmask uploader's face
